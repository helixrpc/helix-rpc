# Language Support

Helix RPC is designed around a multi-language philosophy, recognising that different languages excel at different parts of the AI stack. All three runtimes now share **100% feature parity** across the core production feature set.

| Code Generation | ✅ | — | ✅ | ✅ |

> **Note:** `—` means the feature is not applicable to that runtime's role (e.g. SHM is not relevant to Python/Node.js as a standalone server; PyO3 is a Rust-only capability).

## Go (`runtimes/go`)

Go is the king of highly concurrent, networked routing. We use Go for the **Gateway layer** where horizontal scaling and request fan-in/fan-out are paramount.

**Key Strengths:**
- **Lock-Free `LeastConnBalancer`** with cache-line padding eliminates mutex contention at 10k+ RPS.
- **Multi-Protocol Multiplexing** on a single port: gRPC, REST, Apache Thrift, SSE.
- **Full Interceptor Chain** with `UnaryServerInterceptor` hooks for logging, auth, and tracing.
- **Circuit Breaker + Hedging** to prevent cascading failures under tail latency.

*Use Go when building high-throughput API Gateways or multi-protocol edge proxies.*

---

## Rust (`runtimes/rust`)

Rust is the king of memory safety and zero-cost abstractions. We use Rust where deep system integration and absolute raw compute speed are paramount.

**Key Strengths:**
- **PyO3 Zero-Serialization Python Embedding** — the Rust gateway calls Python model functions directly in-process with zero network hops and zero JSON overhead.
- **`tokio`-native async I/O** with HTTP/2 multiplexing via `hyper`.
- **Atomic `CircuitBreaker` + `TokenBucket`** for production-hardened retry/hedging.
- **`BatchScheduler`** that aggregates concurrent requests into a single GPU dispatch window.

*Use Rust when you need absolute minimum inference latency by co-locating the gateway with the AI model in the same memory space.*

## Python (`runtime-python`)

Python is the king of AI modeling (PyTorch, Transformers, vLLM). While Helix RPC natively embeds Python into the Rust runtime via PyO3, Python is also fully supported as a **first-class standalone language**.

**Key Strengths:**
- **`asyncio` Dynamic BatchScheduler** — transparently aggregates concurrent HTTP requests into vectorised GPU batches without any extra infrastructure.
- **Graceful Shutdown** — SIGTERM/SIGINT handling with configurable drain period, matching the Go and Rust gateway behaviour.
- **`HelixError` + `ErrorCode`** — structured gRPC status codes automatically converted to HTTP status in the handler.
- **`CircuitBreaker`, `RetryPolicy`, `TokenBucket`** — full Python port of the Go/Rust resilience primitives via `helix_rt.retry`.
- **Probabilistic OpenTelemetry Sampling** — 1% default sampling rate prevents collector overload in production.

*Use Python when writing a pure-Python model server that still needs enterprise-grade batching, retries, and observability.*

---

## Node.js (`runtime-node`)

Node.js is the king of asynchronous, lightweight backend APIs. Node.js is fully supported as a **first-class standalone runtime** for building microservices, AI orchestrators, or middleware wrappers.

**Key Strengths:**
- **Zero-Dependency Sniffing Server** — Implements an efficient connection-sniffing engine mapping TCP/HTTP/gRPC/FlatBuffers requests on a single port.
- **Dynamic BatchScheduler** — Transparently batches parallel incoming requests into unified callback runs.
- **Built-in JWT & API Key Middlewares** — Standard cryptographic authorization helpers native in TypeScript.
- **Resilience Helpers** — Token Bucket rate limiter and Exponential Backoff retry policies.

*Use Node.js when writing serverless APIs or microservice routers inside the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem.*
